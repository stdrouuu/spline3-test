## About This Project  
This project is a personal learning experience in designing 3D scenes & models using **Spline**, integrated to **React**. this project served as a testbed for experimenting combining 3D design with frontend development, giving me full hands-on experience.
* On desktop, the model reacts to mouse movement, allowing real-time tracking as the user hovers around.
* On mobile devices, the interaction is triggered by touch, where holding the screen activates the motion tracking behavior.

## Vite + React Setup  
Uses a minimal setup to get React working in **Vite**, with **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** and basic ESLint configuration.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
